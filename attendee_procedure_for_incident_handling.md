%%CONFERENCE%% Attendee Procedure for Incident Handling 
===============================================

If you are a %%CONFERENCE%% attendee and you are being harassed, notice that
someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please follow do
the following:

**1. Make sure everyone is physically safe.** If there is a threat to anyone's
physical safety, including yourself, summon security or law enforcement. Local
law enforcement can be contacted by calling 911. If you do not have a cell
phone, you can use any venue phone or ask a conference staff member for
assistance. If everyone is physically safe, involve law enforcement or security
only at a victim's request. 

**2. Inform the Code of Conduct team of the incident.** Contact

conduct and incident reporting procedure, and can assist you in contacting
these individuals. 

**3. Report the details to the Code of Conduct team.** Provide
%%COC_TEAM_FIRST_NAMES%% with a report describing the incident, preferably by
email. All reports are confidential.

about the incident. The conference staff will assist you in collecting
information and writing the report.

The report should include the following important:

- The name(s) or description(s) of the individual(s) doing the harassing.
- The name(s) or description(s) of any other individual(s) involved in the
